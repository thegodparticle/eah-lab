Niyazi Ömer Arslan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology at the University of South Alabama and the director of the **Electric & Acoustic Hearing Lab**.

His research investigates the intersection of **psychoacoustics** and **auditory neuroscience**, with a primary focus on improving hearing outcomes for cochlear implant recipients. He is particularly interested in how neural health influences the efficacy of electrical field shaping techniques.

Before joining South Alabama, Dr. Arslan completed his Ph.D. at Arizona State University, where he studied the effects of neural health on electrical stimulation. He also holds an M.Sc. from Marmara University and a B.Sc. from Bezmialem Vakif University in Istanbul.
